# BABY :baby:

Users’ generative AI poetry InterFace

## IDEA

- Can an Artificial Intelligence be creative?
- Is is possible to change the type of influence by shifting the content of the influencer within the same context?
- Will BABY be able to learn the "language of influence" to know how to restructure and transform information into poetic computation?

## GPT-3 [Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)

- Project by non-profit [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI)
- Deep-learning [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) model
- Pretrained on approximately 750 billion tokens that is 500_000 bibles (one token = ¾ word)
- The ability to be fine-tuned

## DATA 

- Content: 
    Web scraping 50000+ tweets from influential profiles
- Form: 
    Databases: lyrics, poems, haikus [(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/)
    
## FINE-TUNING AND TRAINING

- Feeding the training data to the model
- Finding the right parameters
    *e.g temperature, frequency penalty
- Prompt engineering
- Training the model on the most fitting "prompt"

## PROCESS

Content + Form  **→**  GPT-3  **→**  BABY BORN

## PURPOSE

BABY is the final project that I worked on in Le Wagon with my teammates, Guillaume De Sa, Marco Zausch, Tim Seifert, during our Data Science program.

<poem>
    
    The word is flat
    
    by: BABY
    

    "The search to find

    The perfect word

    To describe

    The way we feel.

    The search to find

    The perfect phrase

    To share our feelings

    In a neat and tidy way."
          
</poem>
