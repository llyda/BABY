# BABY
 
is the sound of circuit bending with a Computer

# IDEA

- Can an Artificial Intelligence be creative?
- Is is possible to change the type of influence by shifting the content of the influencer within the same context?

*BABY: does understand once it's influenced
*BABY: does not undertand without influence
*BABY: influences based on influencers

...then it creates poetry.


# GPT-3 [Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3]

- Project by non-profit OpenAI
- Deep-learning NLP model
- Powerful, yet not conscious
- Pretrained on approximately 750 billion tokens that is 500_000 bibles (one token = Â¾ word)
- The bility to be fine-tuned


# DATA 

- Content: 
    Web scraping 50000+ tweets from influential profiles
- Form: 
    Databases: lyrics, poems, haikus (Kaggle)
    
# FINE-TUNING AND TRAINING

- Feeding the training data to the model
- Finding the right parameters
    *e.g temperature, frequency penalty
- Prompt engineering
- Training the model on the most fitting "prompt"

# PROCESS

- Content + Form ----> AI GPT-3 Model -----> BABY BORN 

BABY is the final project that I worked on in Le Wagon with my teammates, Guillaume De Sa, Marco Zausch, Tim Seifert, during our Data Science program. 

It is a project I plan to continue working on.

"The search to find

The perfect word

To describe

The way we feel.

The search to find

The perfect phrase

To share our feelings

In a neat and tidy way"
