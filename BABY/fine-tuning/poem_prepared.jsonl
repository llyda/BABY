{"prompt":"","completion":" The stream’s music did not stop"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Flowing through heather, limpid brown,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although they sat in a coffee shop"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And they were neither up nor down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The bell was silent in the air"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Holding its inverted poise—"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Between the clang and clang a flower,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A brazen calyx of no noise:"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The bell was silent in the air."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The camels crossed the miles of sand"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The desert was their own, they planned"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The camels crossed the miles of sand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The waiter did not come, the clock"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Came out like water from a rock:"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her fingers flicked away the ash"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That bloomed again in tropic trees:"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not caring if the markets crash"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When they had forests such as these,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Her fingers flicked away the ash."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" God or whatever means the Good"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" It is patent to the eye that cannot face the sun"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The smug philosophers lie who say the world is one;"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Nothing begins or ends, no one loves or fights,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All your foes are friends and all your days are nights"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And all the roads lead round and are not roads at all"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The modern monist too castrates, negates our lives"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And nothing that we do, make or become survives,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His terror of confusion freezes the flowing stream"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Into mere illusion, his craving for supreme"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Completeness means be chokes each orifice with tight"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Plaster as he evokes a dead ideal of white"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All-white Universal, refusing to allow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Division or dispersal—Eternity is now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Now is therefore numb, a fact he does not see"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Postulating a dumb static identity"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of Essence and Existence which could not fuse without"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Banishing to a distance belief along with doubt,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Action along with error, growth along with gaps;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If man is a mere mirror of God, the gods collapse."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No, the formula fails that fails to make it clear"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That only change prevails, that the seasons make the year,"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Not to be cancelled out, not to be merged in world,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Its entity a denial of all that is not it,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Its every move a trial through chaos and the Pit,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An absolute and so defiant of the One"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Absolute, the row of noughts where time is done,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where nothing goes or comes and Is is one with Ought"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And all the possible sums alike resolve to nought."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" World is not like that, world is full of blind"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gulfs across the flat, jags against the mind,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Swollen or diminished according to the dice,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Foaming, never finished, never the same twice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You talk of Ultimate Value, Universal Form—"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Visions, let me tell you, that ride upon the storm"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And must be made and sought but cannot be maintained,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lost as soon as caught, always to be regained,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mainspring of our striving towards perfection, yet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would not be worth achieving if the world were set"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fair, if error and choice did not exist, if dumb"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" World should find its voice for good and God become"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Incarnate once for all. No, perfection means"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Something but must fall unless there intervenes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Between that meaning and the matter it should fill"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Time’s revolving hand that never can be still."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Which being so and life a ferment, you and I"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can only live by strife in that the living die,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And, if we use the word Eternal, stake a claim"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only to what a bird can find within the frame"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of momentary flight (the value will persist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But as event the night sweeps it away in mist)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Man is man because he might have been a beast"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And is not what he was and feels himself increased,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Man is man in as much as he is not god and yet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hankers to see and touch the pantheon and forget"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The means within the end and man is truly man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In that he would transcend and flout the human span:"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A species become rich by seeing things as wrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And patching them, to which I am proud that I belong."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Man is surely mad with discontent, he is hurled"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By lovely hopes or bad dreams against the world,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Raising a frail scaffold in never-ending flux,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stubbornly when baffled fumbling the stubborn crux"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And so he must continue, raiding the abyss"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With aching bone and sinew, conscious of things amiss,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Conscious of guilt and vast inadequacy and the sick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ego and the broken past and the clock that goes too quick,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Conscious of waste of labour, conscious of spite and hate,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of dissension with his neighbour, of beggars at the gate,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But conscious also of love and the joy of things and the power"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of going beyond and above the limits of the lagging hour,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Conscious of sunlight, conscious of death’s inveigling touch,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not completely conscious but partly—and that is much."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The room was suddenly rich and the great bay-window was"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Spawning snow and pink roses against it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Soundlessly collateral and incompatible:"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" World is suddener than we fancy it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" World is crazier and more of it than we think,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Incorrigibly plural. I peel and portion"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A tangerine and spit the pips and feel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The drunkenness of things being various."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the fire flames with a bubbling sound for world"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is more spiteful and gay than one supposes— "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the tongue on the eyes on the ears in the palms of one's hands—"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Robert Frost poetAnd sorry I could not travel both"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And be one traveler, long I stood"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And looked down one as far as I could"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To where it bent in the undergrowth;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then took the other, as just as fair,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And having perhaps the better claim,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Because it was grassy and wanted wear;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though as for that the passing there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Had worn them really about the same,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And both that morning equally lay"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In leaves no step had trodden black."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, I kept the first for another day!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet knowing how way leads on to way,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I doubted if I should ever come back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I shall be telling this with a sigh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Somewhere ages and ages hence:"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I took the one less traveled by,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And that has made all the difference."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sylvan historian, who canst thus express"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What leaf-fring’d legend haunts about thy shape"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of deities or mortals, or of both,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear’d,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And, happy melodist, unwearied,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For ever piping songs for ever new;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" More happy love! more happy, happy love!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For ever warm and still to be enjoy’d,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For ever panting, and for ever young;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All breathing human passion far above,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy’d,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A burning forehead, and a parching tongue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who are these coming to the sacrifice?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To what green altar, O mysterious priest,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What little town by river or sea shore,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And, little town, thy streets for evermore"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Will silent be; and not a soul to tell"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why thou art desolate, can e’er return."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of marble men and maidens overwrought,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With forest branches and the trodden weed;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the years I’ve been at this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (Lots, not to be precise)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You’d think that once or twice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At least I would have seen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some anomalies. I mean"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some major ones. As in"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not feet but little wheels,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or crests like cockatiels’."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where are they keeping the girls"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With a chrome exterior,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Or an extra derriere?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apparently nowhere."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Assuming my sample’s valid,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The pool is limited"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Such variance as there is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the usual congeries"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of   physiognomies —"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" To be worth the looking at."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The walking by, for that,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of   the same girl over and over"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Would be no cross to bear"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If   it were that one there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Life, like a marble block, is given to all,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A blank, inchoate mass of years and days,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whence one with ardent chisel swift essays"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some shape of strength or symmetry to call;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One shatters it in bits to mend a wall;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One in a craftier hand the chisel lays,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And one, to wake the mirth in Lesbia’s gaze,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Carves it apace in toys fantastical."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But least is he who, with enchanted eyes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Filled with high visions of fair shapes to be,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Muses which god he shall immortalize"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" What I envy in the open eyes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" of the dead deer hanging down"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" from the rafters, its eyes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" still wet and glassy, but locked now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" into a vision of another life,"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" staring at the moment when"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" it died. The blue light"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" falling through the window"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" into this smoke-filled room"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" is the same color as the mist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" coming down off the mountain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" that morning: the deer sees"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" men with guns"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" but also sees, beyond them,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" the endless mountains."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, but to fade, and live we know not where,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To be a cold obstruction and to groan!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This sensible, warm woman to become"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A prudish clod; and the delighted spirit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To live and die alone, or to reside"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With married sisters, and to have the care"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of half a dozen children, not your own;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And driven, for no one wants you,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Round the pendant world; or worse than worse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of those that disappointment and pure spite"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have driven to madness: ’Tis too horrible!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The weariest and most troubled married life"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That age, ache, penury, or jealousy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Can lay on nature, is a paradise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To being an old maid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That very time I saw, (but thou couldst not,)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Walking between the garden and the barn,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reuben, all armed; a certain aim he took"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At a young chicken standing by a post,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And loosed his bullet smartly from his gun,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he would kill a hundred thousand hens."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I might see young Reuben’s fiery shot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lodged in the chaste board of the garden fence,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the domesticated fowl passed on,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In henly meditation, bullet free."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My father had a daughter got a man,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As it might be, perhaps, were I good-looking,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I should, your lordship."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And what’s her residence?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A hut my lord, she never owned a house,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But let her husband, like a graceless scamp,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Spend all her little means,—she thought she ought,—"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And in a wretched chamber, on an alley,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She worked like masons on a monument,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Earning their bread. Was not this love indeed?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Others abide our question. Thou art free."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We ask and ask—Thou smilest and art still,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Spares but the cloudy border of his base"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To the foil'd searching of mortality;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Didst tread on earth unguess'd at.—Better so!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All pains the immortal spirit must endure,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Find their sole speech in that victorious brow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Spirit of BEAUTY, that dost consecrate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of human thought or form, where art thou gone?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ask why the sunlight not for ever"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" They spoke of a new land far away cross the sea"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The vessel was crowded with disquieted folk"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Each one fought back tears and felt strangely alone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The seas roared in anger, making desperate our plight"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And a fever came oer me that worsened next night"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then delirium possessed me and clouded my mind"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I for a moment saw that land left behind."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I could hear in the distance my dear mothers wailing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the prayers of three brothers that Id see no more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I felt fathers tears as he begged for forgiveness"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For seeking a new life on the still distant shore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Over in Killarney"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many years ago,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Me Mither sang a song to me"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" And ld give the world if she could sing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That song to me this day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, hush now, dont you cry!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, thats an Irish lullaby."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oft in dreams I wander"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To that cot again,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I feel her arms a-huggin me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As when she held me then."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I hear her voice a -hummin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To me as in days of yore,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When she used to rock me fast asleep"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Outside the cabin door."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And who are you, me pretty fair maid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And who are you, me honey?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She answered me quite modestly:"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" And she led me to the table"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Saying: Theres plenty of wine for a soldier boy,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To drink it if youre able."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then I got up and made the bed"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" And when will we get married"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When broken shells make Christmas bells"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Out from the sweet town of Derry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For Australia bound if we didnt all drown"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the marks of our fetters we carried."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the rusty iron chains we sighed for our wains"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" As the mainsails unfurled our curses we hurled"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the English and thoughts of tomorrow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh Oh Oh Oh I wish I was back home in Derry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I cursed them to hell as our bow fought the swell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Our ship danced like a moth in the firelights."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Taking souls to Hades by twilight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Five weeks out to sea we were now forty-three"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Our comrades we buried each morning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In our own slime we were lost in a time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Endless night without dawning."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Van Diemans land is a hell for a man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To live out his life in slavery."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" And the bright eyes of my darling are never on me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My Sunday it is weary, my Sunday it is grey now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My heart is a cold thing, my heart is a stone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All joy is dead within me, my life has gone away now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For another has taken my love for his own."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The day it is approaching when we were to be married"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And its rather I would die than live only to grieve"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh meet me, my Darling, eer the sun sets oer the barley"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Ill meet you there on the road to Drumslieve."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh Bridgit OMalley, youve left my heart shaken"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I wish I was in Carrigfergus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only for nights in Ballygrant"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I would swim over the deepest ocean"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For my love to find"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the sea is wide and I cannot cross over"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And neither have I the wings to fly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I wish I could meet a handsome boatsman"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To ferry me over, to my love and die."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My childhood days bring back sad reflections"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of happy times I spent so long ago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My boyhood friends and my own relations"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Have all passed on now like melting snow."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Ill spend my days in endless roaming"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Soft is the grass, my bed is free."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, to be back now in Carrigfergus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On that long road down to the sea."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But in Kilkenny, it is reported"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" With gold and silver I would support her"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Ill sing no more till I get a drink."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For Im drunk today, and Im seldom sober"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A handsome rover from town to town"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, but Im sick now, my days are numbered"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You may travel far far from your own native land"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Far away oer the mountains, far away oer the foam"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But of all the fine places that Ive ever been"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sure theres none can compare with the cliffs of Doneen."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Youll see the high rocky mountains oer the west coast of Clare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh the town of Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Doneen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Its a nice place to be on a fine summers day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Watching all the wild flowers that neer do decay"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh the hares and lofty pheasants are plain to be seen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Making homes for their young round the cliffs of Doneen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fare thee well to Doneen, fare thee well for a while"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And to all the kind people Im leaving behind"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To the streams and the meadows where late I have been"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Doneen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In Dublins fair city, where the girls are so pretty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As she wheeled her wheel-barrow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Through streets broad and narrow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-O!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Alive, alive-O! alive, alive-O!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She was a fish-monger, but sure twas no wonder"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For so were her father and mother before"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And they each wheeled their barrow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She died of a fever, and no one could save her"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But her ghost wheels her barrow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Garden of Eden has vanished, they say"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I know the lie of it still;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just turn to the left at the bridge of Finea"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And stop when halfway to Cootehill."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tis there I will find it,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I know sure enough"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When fortune has come to me call,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh the grass it is green around Ballyjamesduff"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Come back, Paddy Reilly to Ballyjamesduff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Come home, Paddy Reilly, to me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My mother once told me that when I was born"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The day that I first saw the light,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked down the street on that very first morn"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And gave a great crow of delight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now most newborn babies appear in a huff,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And start with a sorrowful squall,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But I knew I was born in Ballyjamesduff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And thats why I smiled on them all."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The babys a man, now hes toil-worn and tough"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still, whispers come over the sea,"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" One morning in July"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Till a smiling bride by my own fireside"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sits the star of the County Down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was early, early in the spring"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The birds did whistle and sweetly sing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Changing their notes from tree to tree"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the song they sang was Old Ireland free."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was early early in the night,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The yeoman cavalry gave me a fright"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The yeoman cavalry was my downfall"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I was taken by Lord Cornwall."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Twas in the guard-house where I was laid,"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" When to Dungannon I was forced to go."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As I was passing my fathers door"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My brother William stood at the door"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My aged father stood at the door"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And my tender mother her hair she tore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As I was going up Wexford Street"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My own first cousin I chanced to meet;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My own first cousin did me betray"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And for one bare guinea swore my life away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As I was walking up Wexford Hill"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who could blame me to cry my fill?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I looked behind, and I looked before"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But my aged mother I shall see no more."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And as I mounted the platform high"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My aged father was standing by;"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My aged father did me deny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the name he gave me was the Croppy Boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was in Dungannon this young man died"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And in Dungannon his body lies."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And you good people that do pass by"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh shed a tear for the Croppy Boy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One morning early I walked forth"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the margin of Lough Leane"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sunshine dressed the trees in green"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And summer bloomed again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I left the town and wandered on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Through fields all green and gay"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And whom should I meet but a colleen sweet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the dawning of the day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No cap or cloak this maiden wore"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" A milking pail was in her hand"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She was lovely, young and gay"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She wore the palm from Venus bright"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the dawning of the day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On a mossy bank I sat me down"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With the maiden by my side"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With gentle words I courted her"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And asked her to be my bride"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She said, Young man dont bring me blame"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And swiftly turned away"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the morning light was shining bright"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By a lonely prison wall"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I heard a sweet voice calling,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Danny, they have taken you away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For you stole Travelians corn,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That your babes might see the morn,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fair lie the fields of Athenry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where once we watched the small freebirds fly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Our love grew with the spring,"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" But shell watch and hope and pray,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For her love in Botany Bay"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whilst she is lonely in the fields of Athenry."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, a wan cloud was drawn oer the dim weeping dawn"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" But the sudden sun kissd the cold, cruel mist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Into dancing showrs of diamond dew"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the dark flowing stream laughd back to his beam"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the lark soared aloft in the blue"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While no phantom of night but a form of delight"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ran with arms outspread to her darling boy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the girl I love best on my wild throbbing breast"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" And often in those grand old woods Ill sit and shut my eyes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And my heart will wander back again to the place where Mary lies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I think Ill see that little stile where we sat side by side"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the springing corn and the bright May morn when first you were my bride."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When I was at home I was merry and frisky,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My dad kept a pig and my mother sold whisky,"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" And everybody calls me by the name of Johnny Dhu."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of all the trades a going, sure the begging is the best"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But to slip around the corner with his old rigadoo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I slept in a barn one night in Currabawn"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" And an old fashioned lady I will make her too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So all along the high road with my bag upon my back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Over the fields with my bulging heavy sack"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With holes in my shoes and my toes a peeping thru"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Singing, skin a ma rink a doodle with my auld rigadoo."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" O I must be going to bed for its getting late at night"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The fire is all raked and now tis out of light"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For now youve heard the story of my auld rigadoo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So good and God be with you, from auld Johnny Dhu."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, the days of the Kerry dancing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh, the ring of the pipers tune"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Or a prouder lad than Thady"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he boldly took the floor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lads and lasses to your places"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Up the middle and down again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ah, the merry hearted laughter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ringing through the happy glen!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Time goes on, and the happy years are dead"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And one by one the merry hearts are fled"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Silent now is the wild and lonely glen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Where the bright glad laugh will echo neer again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only dreaming of days gone by in my heart I hear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Loving voices of old companions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stealing out of the past once more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the sound of the dear old music"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Soft and sweet as in days of yore."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Dear thoughts are in my mind"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And my soul soars enchanted,"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As I hear the sweet lark sing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the clear air of the day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a tender beaming smile"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To my hope has been granted,"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" One faithful harp shall praise thee!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Minstrel fell! But the foemans chain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Could not bring that proud soul under"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The harp he lovd neer spoke again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For he tore its chords asunder"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And said No chains shall sully thee"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Theres a form at the casement, the form of her true love"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And he whispers with face bent, Im waiting for you love"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Lazily, easily, now swings the wheel round"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slowly and lowly is heard now the reels sound"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Noiseless and light to the lattice above her"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The maid steps, then leaps to the arms of her lover."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Slower... and slower... and slower the wheel swings"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lower... and lower... and lower the reel rings"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ere the reel and the wheel stop their ringing and moving"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Through the grove the young lovers by moonlight are roving."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As I roved out one morning"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Near the verdant braes of Skreen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I put my back to the mossy tree"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To view the dew on the West Countrie"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The dew on the foreign strand."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" O sit ye down on the grass, he said"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the dewy grass so green"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" And your hearts no longer mine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" O I will climb a high high tree"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Ill rob a wild birds nest"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And back Ill bring what I find there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To the arms that I love best, he said"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To the arms that I love best."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The water is wide, I cannot get oer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Neither have I wings to fly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Give me a boat that can carry two"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And both shall row, my love and I"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A ship there is and she sails the sea"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shes loaded deep as deep can be"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But not so deep as the love Im in"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I know not if I sink or swim"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I leaned my back against an oak"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thinking it was a trusty tree"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But first it bent and then it broke"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So did my love prove false to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I reached my finger into some soft bush"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thinking the fairest flower to find"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I pricked my finger to the bone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And left the fairest flower behind"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Oh love be handsome and love be kind"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gay as a jewel when first it is new"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But love grows old and waxes cold"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And fades away like the morning dew"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Must I go bound while you go free"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Must I love a man who doesnt love me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Must I be born with so little art"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As to love a man wholl break my heart"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When cockle shells turn silver bells"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then will my love come back to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When roses bloom in winters gloom"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then will my love return to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" O Paddy dear, and did ye hear the news thats goin round?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The shamrock is by law forbid to grow on Irish ground!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No more Saint Patricks Day well keep, his color cant be seen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For theres a cruel law agin the Wearin o the Green."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I met with Napper Tandy, and he took me by the hand"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And he said, Hows poor old Ireland, and how does she stand?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Shes the most distressful country that ever yet was seen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For theyre hanging men and women there for the Wearin o the Green."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So if the color we must wear be Englands cruel red"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let it remind us of the blood that Irishmen have shed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And pull the shamrock from your hat, and throw it on the sod"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But never fear, twill take root there, though underfoot tis trod."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When laws can stop the blades of grass from growin as they grow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And when the leaves in summer-time their color dare not show"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then I will change the color too I wear in my caubeen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But till that day, please God, Ill stick to the Wearin o the Green."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ive been a wild rover for many a year"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I spent all my money on whiskey and beer,"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" I asked her for credit, she answered me nay"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Such a custom as yours I could have any day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the landladys eyes opened wide with delight."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She said I have whiskey and wines of the best"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And the words that I spoke sure were only in jest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ill go home to my parents, confess what Ive done"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And Ill ask them to pardon their prodigal son."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And if they caress (forgive) me as ofttimes before"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sure I never will play the wild rover no more."}
